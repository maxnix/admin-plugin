# Admin Plugin artifacts

This package contains the ABIs of the OSx Admin plugin, as well as the address of the plugin repository on each supported network.

## Installation

yarn add @aragon/admin-plugin-artifacts
```

## Usage

```typescript
import {

    AdminABI
} from "@aragon/admin-plugin-artifacts";

You can also open [addresses.json](./src/addresses.json) directly.


## Development

### Building the package

Install the dependencies and generate the local ABI definitions.

```sh
yarn --ignore-scripts
yarn build
```

The `build` script will:
1. Move to `packages/contracts`.
2. Install its dependencies.
3. Compile the contracts using Hardhat.
4. Generate their ABI.
5. Extract their ABI and embed it into on `src/abi.ts`.

### Syncing the deployment addresses

Clone [OSx Commons](https://github.com/aragon/osx-commons) in a folder next to this repo.

```sh
yarn sync-addresses
```
